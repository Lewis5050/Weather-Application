#Weather-Application
This is my first major project, which is a weather application that can retrieve the weather for towns and cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMaps API. This is the 3rd rendition of the project, the first was originally a 'Windows Form' application, with very messy code behind the UI. After learning of WPF (being a more preferred and modern alternative to 'Windows Forms', I recreated it as a WPF). Still unsatisfied with the quality of the code behind, I created this 3rd version using WPF and incorperating MVVM architectural pattern (as best I can) to try and make the code behind cleaner.
