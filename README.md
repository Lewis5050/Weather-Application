# Weather-Application

This is my first major project, which is a weather application that can retrieve the weather for towns and cities around the world using the OpenWeatherMaps API. This is the 3rd rendition of the project, the first was originally a 'Windows Form' application, with very messy code behind the UI, as well as unformatted and ugly XAML.

 After learning of WPF (being a more preferred and modern alternative to 'Windows Forms'), I recreated it as a WPF. However, at the time I was unaware of WPF's ability to break down UI into 'Grids' and 'Stackpanels' and faced the same complicated and unclear XAML. Determined to fix the application to a level I was happy with I then created the 3rd version which is the one stored in this repository.
 
The XAML in this 3rd version is clear, and well formatted, as is the code behind. During this rendition I have attempted to implement the MVVM ('Model-View-View-Model') architectural pattern both for good practice and to result in a much smoother and cleaner code behind.
